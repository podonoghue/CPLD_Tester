INFO:Xst:2371 - HDL ADVISOR - Logic functions respectively driving the data and gate enable inputs of this latch share common terms. This situation will potentially lead to setup/hold violations and, as a result, to simulation problems. This situation may come from an incomplete case statement (all selector values are not covered). You should carefully review if it was in your intentions to describe such a latch.
    Found 32-bit register for signal <leds>.
    Found 7-bit up counter for signal <counter>.
    Found 1-bit register for signal <toggle>.
